%% Homework 6 - Brainstorming Term Project 
% 1. Who is involved in your study? (list all group members)
% The people involved in the study are Curtis Crandhall, Hayden Lewis, and
% Alex Edwards. 
%
% 2. In a general sense, what is the topic you plan to study?
% The topic that we are planning to study is the mass balance flow through
% the Boise Basin. There is data collected from Curtis regarding the water
% input and outputs within the Basin. This data is raw, so there will need
% to be some sort of data reduced to create presentable information. The
% hope is to use equations to create graphs and give us a better
% understanding to the mass balance effect that occurs within the Boise
% area. 
%
% 3. Identify any key references or articles you will need to read in order to complete your study?
% References will include information provided from Curtis, and possibly
% from instructors within the hydrology department. Another reference would
% be mathworks.com to look up any code necessary to create various graphs. 
% There are numerous articles that we can read as well in order to gain
% insight to the process necessary to create understandable graphs. Some 
% articles include:

% 4. What type of data will you be modeling or analyzing? (e.g. time series, spatial maps)
% For this project we will need to use modeling and a time series to create
% hydrographs within certain time periods. The data will be stream flow
% rates collected at certain stations within 
%
% 5. What are the inputs and outputs of your code?
% Inputs would include stream flow data, rate of discharge, soil
% characteristics. Also dates and times in which collection occurs. 
% Outputs would be information such as hydrographs, recharge values,
% season variability. 
%
% 6. How will you know if your code is correct? (e.g. can you compare with existing results?)
% There is data available both online and through the library that we can
% compare our data to. There are also several papers that have been written
% by scholars in the field and even at Boise State that we can check
% resources with. 
%
% 7. What type of logic will your code use? (e.g. for loops, if,else statements, etc.)
% We will be using large amounts of for-loops and functions to crunch large
% data sets. We may use if-else statements to exclude data that doesn't fit
% within a certain range of the experiment -- outliers. We also may use
% catch statements to find or remove errors in the data-set, as NaN's or
% errors may be prevalent. 
%
% 8. How will you present the inputs and outputs? (e.g. 2D plots, histograms, etc.)
% We will present out data in the form of box-whisker plots to show
% deviation and mean values as recharge may vary seasonally. We will use
% histograms to show variations in recharge through time, we may even have
% a red line that denotes the RMSE (root mean squared error) of the data.
% The red line ultimately will help determine the wellness of fit. There
% will also be multiple graphs, some in the form of hydrographs, to
% represent some of the data we have collected. 
%
% 9. What is the significance of the output data? (e.g. how can it be analyzed or used)
% The significance of the output data is information that would be
% available to the general public regarding data for hydrogeologic problems
% within the Boise Basin area. It can also give information about climate
% and the ecology of the area. 
%
% 10. Are there any parts to your project that you currently do not know how to accomplish or implement?
% Which parts will you need help from me, if any?
% Most of the conceptual questions are easily answered from knowledge from
% previous classes. At the moment, there is not any questions that we have,
% but it is likely that inquiries regarding computing in MATLAB will occur
% once the project gets fully started.
