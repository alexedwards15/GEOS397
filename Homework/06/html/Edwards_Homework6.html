% 1. Who is involved in your study? (list all group members)
% The people involved in the study are Curtis Crandhall, Hayden Lewis, and

% 2. In a general sense, what is the topic you plan to study?
% The topic that we are planning to study is the mass balance flow through
% the Boise Basin. There is data collected from Curtis regarding the water
% input and outputs within the Basin. This data is raw, so there will need
% to be some sort of data reduced to create presentable information. The
% hope is to use equations to create graphs and give us a better
% understanding to the mass balance effect that occurs within the Boise
% area. 

% 3. Identify any key references or articles you will need to read in order to complete your study?
% References will include information provided from Curtis, and possibly
% from instructors within the hydrology department. Another reference would
% be mathworks.com to look up any code necessary to create various graphs. 
% There are numerous articles that we can read as well in order to gain
